# Wasserman â€“ All of Statistics

## Chapter 1
 1. Probability asks: "given a data generating process, what are the outcomes?" while statistical inference asks "given the outcomes, what was the data generating process?"
 2. Statistics is intertwined today with ML with different terminologies in CS and stats playing the same role.
 For example: estimation - learning, classification - clustering, covariates - features (the $X_i s$ in $(X_i,Y_i)$), data - training sample etc
